# About

In our culture, carpio means being persistent, positive, and loves to meet challenges, each staff here should behave like carpio leaping high out of the water, full of enthusiasm to get into the work.

The main goal is to offer better service to those in desperate need of sourcing relevant products besides the products we were allowed to provide. We can provide a full line of glass products from regular glass to special purpose glass, and wild selection of its related accessories. You can ask for anything from building materials to decorative materials including finished products regarding the building industry, and you can also source from office supplies to home appliances.
